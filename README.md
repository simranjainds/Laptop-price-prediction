# Laptop-price-prediction
linear regression problem

With the development of society and looking at today's situation, everything demands technology and a shorter and quicker way to do things and subsequently many of us are shifting to the digital lifestyle which leads to lots of laptop purchases online and in-store, hence an effective way is required to categorize which laptops suit an individual need. This study is carried out to interpret the price of the laptop based on its different features like company, RAM, memory, Type, weight and operating system.

This study includes some feature engineering in which new features are made from existing ones. Furthermore, categorical variables are converted into machine-readable forms using different encoding types. After all the data pre-processing was carried out, machine learning algorithms were tested and compared. The algorithms which were used were random forest, decision tree, linear regression, XGBoost, XGBoost with optuna and support vector regression out of which a good R2 score was for the XGBoost algorithm with Optuna Optimization of around 92.33 .
